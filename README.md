# Tetris-Game
this will be my new project , a Tetris game!
The biggest thing that i will be working on is how it looks.
it is not the hardest thing to do.
but i will have a hard time learning JS in the progress and i feel like CSS is not that hard. 
when i feel confident enough i want to make my own website , but before i do that i just want to start with some silly games.
i like making these "easy" games , it just feels nice to make them and it fun to see how it turned out in the end.
